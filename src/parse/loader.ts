/**
 * Loader (design spec §5) — the front door of the compiler. It takes raw `.todl`
 * source text and produces a fully-populated {@link Repository} (the reflective
 * typed graph) plus a flat list of {@link Diagnostic}s. Everything downstream —
 * validation, emit, publish, the language server — reads the graph this file
 * builds.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────── The graph it builds ─────────────────────────────
 * A Repository wraps a graph of NODES and typed EDGES.
 *   • A node is `{ id, tier, typeOf, attrs }`. `tier` is Ontology (types:
 *     concepts, taxonomies, annotations, operators…) or Instance (concrete
 *     objects + models). `typeOf` is the node's meta-kind or its concept.
 *   • Scalar data lives in `attrs` (a field like `name = "x"` becomes an attr) —
 *     it needs NO node. Only *relationships between nodes* become edges:
 *       - Contains       structural parent → child (a model contains its objects,
 *                         a record contains its nested records)
 *       - InstanceOf     an instance → its class/term
 *       - Subtype        `extends` parent
 *       - Relationship   a `->` member or a reference-typed field pointing at
 *                         another node (carries the member name in `via`)
 *       - Targets        an operator → the edge concept it mints
 *
 * ───────────────────────── Why several passes? (forward refs) ──────────────────
 * TODL lets you reference names before they are declared, and instances lean on
 * type information that only exists once types are committed. So the loader stages
 * the graph in dependency order, each pass committing before the next reads it:
 *
 *   PARSE            every source → AST; flattened into `units` (one per top-level
 *                    declaration, tagged with its namespace + imports + file uri).
 *   RESOLVE (pre)    walk every reference, gate it by namespace visibility, and
 *                    rewrite qualified / bare names to their flat node id BEFORE
 *                    anything is staged. Unresolved ids are collected so their
 *                    edges can be dropped at commit time.
 *   PASS 1           bare type declarations — primitives, concepts (+extends),
 *                    taxonomies (+terms), annotations, viewpoints, operators.
 *   PASS 2a          concept/annotation MEMBERS (fields, relationships) +
 *                    invariants. Committed before instances so a nested record can
 *                    consult its parent's schema.
 *   PASS 2b          INSTANCES + models + deferred term values + compositions —
 *                    the concrete objects, whose value refs become edges.
 *   APPLICATIONS     annotation applications (`target@Ann`) on concepts, taxonomy
 *                    terms, the package node, and class instances.
 *   INVARIANTS       executable predicates register on the model, last.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────── Undefined references ──────────────────────────────
 * Any id referenced but never defined (here or in a previously-loaded base model)
 * emits `reference.undefined` and is added to `undefinedIds`. Every
 * `Builder.commit(undefinedIds)` then drops staged edges touching those ids — so
 * no dangling/placeholder nodes are ever created.
 *
 * The staging is done through {@link Builder} (see model/builder.ts): each pass
 * opens a fresh builder, stages nodes/edges, and `commit()`s them into the model.

// mints a real contained node whose from/to members point at the endpoints (so the

// dispatches the two forms, and mintReifiedEdge reuses applyInstance to create the

// (`steps = [ a ==> b ]`), binding the minted node to a field.
